# SCVDT
Source Code Vulnerability Detection Tools（SCVDT）provides a vulnerable code database, vulnerability detection service for Java and C/C++ programs, and other security service.

## JVulDS

## PropertyGraph
A library to generate Abstract Syntax Trees, Control Flow Graphs, Program Dependency Graphs for Java programs.

## HDVerify
HDVerify is a system that can find the input that trigger the suspicious vulnerability in C/C++ open-source software obtained by static tools based on improved directed grey-box fuzzing.

## VulnDB
The vulnerable code database (VulnDB) is a database for vulnerability patch files and their corresponding vulnerable source code and non-vulnerable source code. 

## VKGGen
VKGGen is a tool to collect and process data, and generate vulnerability knowledge graph.

## VKGServe
VKGServe is a background program that performs vulnerability knowledge graph operations. It completes CARD operations on vulnerability knowledge through the form of the Restful API interface.

## Binary-Exploit-Visualization
A tool for binary program to visualize the process of exploit, by analyze the GOT, information leakage, heap memory, shllcode, and function calls.
