 * when you want the parameter sequence to be exactly equal to
 * the raw input, such as when fuzzing with AFL.
 *
 * Use this only with AFL-like front-ends, which return
 * bytes from a fixed-size file. This generator may not work
 * properly with front-ends like Zest that generate fresh
 * values at the end of a parameter sequence, since that would
 * make the InputStream infinitely long.
