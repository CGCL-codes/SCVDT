+         * - no preemption on huge max_pfns input
+         * - not (re-)checking d->is_dying with page_alloc_lock held
+         * - not honoring start_pfn input (which libxc also doesn't set)
+         * Additionally it is rather useless, as the result is stale by the
+         * time the caller gets to look at it.
+         * As it only has a single, non-production consumer (xen-mceinj),
+         * rather than trying to fix it we restrict it for the time being.
