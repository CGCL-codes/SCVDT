+	 * These are even more complicated than FS and GS: they have
+	 * 64-bit bases are that controlled by arch_prctl.  Those bases
+	 * only differ from the values in the GDT or LDT if the selector
+	 * is 0.
+	 *
+	 * Loading the segment register resets the hidden base part of
+	 * the register to 0 or the value from the GDT / LDT.  If the
+	 * next base address zero, writing 0 to the segment register is
+	 * much faster than using wrmsr to explicitly zero the base.
+	 *
+	 * The thread_struct.fs and thread_struct.gs values are 0
+	 * if the fs and gs bases respectively are not overridden
+	 * from the values implied by fsindex and gsindex.  They
+	 * are nonzero, and store the nonzero base addresses, if
+	 * the bases are overridden.
+	 *
+	 * (fs != 0 && fsindex != 0) || (gs != 0 && gsindex != 0) should
+	 * be impossible.
+	 *
+	 * Therefore we need to reload the segment registers if either
+	 * the old or new selector is nonzero, and we need to override
+	 * the base address if next thread expects it to be overridden.
+	 *
+	 * This code is unnecessarily slow in the case where the old and
+	 * new indexes are zero and the new base is nonzero -- it will
+	 * unnecessarily write 0 to the selector before writing the new
+	 * base address.
+	 *
+	 * Note: This all depends on arch_prctl being the only way that
+	 * user code can override the segment base.  Once wrfsbase and
+	 * wrgsbase are enabled, most of this code will need to change.
