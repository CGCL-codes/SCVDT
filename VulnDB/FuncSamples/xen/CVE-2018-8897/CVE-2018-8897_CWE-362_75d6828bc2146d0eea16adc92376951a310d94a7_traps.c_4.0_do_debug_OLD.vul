     *   returning to the interrupted task.

     *   Bits 15:13 of the DR6 register are not cleared by the processor and
     *   must be cleared by software after the contents have been read.
     *
     * Some bits are reserved set, some are reserved clear, and some bits
     * which were previously reserved set are reused and cleared by hardware.
     * For future compatibility, reset to the default value, which will allow
     * us to spot any bit being changed by hardware to its non-default value.
