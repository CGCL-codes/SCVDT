			 *
			 * For now we just let timers with an interval
			 * less than a jiffie expire every jiffie to
			 * avoid softirq starvation in case of SIG_IGN
			 * and a very small interval, which would put
			 * the timer right back on the softirq pending
			 * list. By moving now ahead of time we trick
			 * hrtimer_forward() to expire the timer
			 * later, while we still maintain the overrun
			 * accuracy, but have some inconsistency in
			 * the timer_gettime() case. This is at least
			 * better than a starved softirq. A more
			 * complex fix which solves also another related
			 * inconsistency is already in the pipeline.
