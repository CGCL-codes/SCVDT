/*
 * Note that we don't need to start a transaction unless we're journaling data
 * because we should have holes filled from ext4_page_mkwrite(). We even don't
 * need to file the inode to the transaction's list in ordered mode because if
 * we are writing back data added by write(), the inode is already there and if
 * we are writing back data modified via mmap(), noone guarantees in which
 * transaction the data will hit the disk. In case we are journaling data, we
 * cannot start transaction directly because transaction start ranks above page
 * lock so we have to do some magic.
 *
 * In all journaling modes block_write_full_page() will start the I/O.
 *
 * Problem:
 *
 *	ext4_writepage() -> kmalloc() -> __alloc_pages() -> page_launder() ->
 *		ext4_writepage()
 *
 * Similar for:
 *
 *	ext4_file_write() -> generic_file_write() -> __alloc_pages() -> ...
 *
 * Same applies to ext4_get_block().  We will deadlock on various things like
 * lock_journal and i_data_sem
 *
 * Setting PF_MEMALLOC here doesn't work - too many internal memory
 * allocations fail.
 *
 * 16May01: If we're reentered then journal_current_handle() will be
 *	    non-zero. We simply *return*.
 *
 * 1 July 2001: @@@ FIXME:
 *   In journalled data mode, a data buffer may be metadata against the
 *   current transaction.  But the same file is part of a shared mapping
 *   and someone does a writepage() on it.
 *
 *   We will move the buffer onto the async_data list, but *after* it has
 *   been dirtied. So there's a small window where we have dirty data on
 *   BJ_Metadata.
 *
 *   Note that this only applies to the last partial page in the file.  The
 *   bit which block_write_full_page() uses prepare/commit for.  (That's
 *   broken code anyway: it's wrong for msync()).
 *
 *   It's a rare case: affects the final partial page, for journalled data
 *   where the file is subject to bith write() and writepage() in the same
 *   transction.  To fix it we'll need a custom block_write_full_page().
 *   We'll probably need that anyway for journalling writepage() output.
 *
 * We don't honour synchronous mounts for writepage().  That would be
 * disastrous.  Any write() or metadata operation will sync the fs for
 * us.

 *
 * Note that at recovery time, journal replay occurs *before* the restart of
 * truncate against the orphan inode list.
 *
 * The committed inode has the new, desired i_size (which is the same as
 * i_disksize in this case).  After a crash, ext4_orphan_cleanup() will see
 * that this inode's truncate did not complete and it will again call
 * ext4_truncate() to have another go.  So there will be instantiated blocks
 * to the right of the truncation point in a crashed ext4 filesystem.  But

 * because *any* task may call prune_icache - even ones which
 * have a transaction open against a different journal.
 *
 * Is this cheating?  Not really.  Sure, we haven't written the
 * inode out, but prune_icache isn't a user-visible syncing function.
 * Whenever the user wants stuff synced (sys_sync, sys_msync, sys_fsync)
 * we start and wait on commits.
 *
 * Is this efficient/effective?  Well, we're being nice to the system
 * by cleaning up our inodes proactively so they can be reaped
 * without I/O.  But we are potentially leaving up to five seconds'
 * worth of inodes floating about which prune_icache wants us to
 * write out.  One way to fix that would be to get prune_icache()
 * to do a write_super() to free up some memory.  It has the desired
 * effect.
